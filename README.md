_This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by ldecavel_

### DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to develop a multi-agent pathfinding algorithm on a weighted graph. The program computes collision-free paths for multiple agents, and then displays the simulation using a modern external graphics library.

### INSTRUCTIONS

To **_install_** the project virtual environment :

```bash
make install
```

To **_run_** the program :

```bash
make run [ARGS="map_path window_size"]
```
> [!NOTE]  
> The ARGS are optional, the program targets by default the map ``maps/easy/01_linear_path.txt`` with a window size of ``3``.
> The window_size is a division of your screen (therefore 1 is a full screen window, and 3 is 1/3 of it)

To **_clean_** the files generated by the installation :

```bash
make clean
```

To check flake8 and mypy **_norms_** :

```bash
make lint
```

To check flake8 and mypy **_norms_** with **_strict_** flags :

```bash
make lint-strict
```

To run the program with the **_python debugger_** :

```bash
make debug
```

### ALGORITHMS
 A detailed description of your algorithm choices and implementation strategy must
also be included.

### VISUALIZATION FEATURES
Documentation (?)

### RESOURCES

 “Resources” section listing classic references related to the topic (documentation, articles, tutorials, etc.), as well as a description of how AI was used —
specifying for which tasks and which parts of the project

The links down below helped us in **_understanding_** how works maze generation, and getting
**_inspiration_** before starting. IA helped on **_debugging_**.
