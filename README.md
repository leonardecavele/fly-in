_This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by ldecavel_

### DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to develop a multi-agent pathfinding algorithm on a weighted graph. The program computes collision-free paths for multiple agents, and then displays the simulation using a modern external graphics library.

### INSTRUCTIONS

To **_install_** the project virtual environment :

```bash
make install
```

To **_run_** the program :

```bash
make run [ARGS="map_path window_size"]
```
> [!NOTE]  
> Command-line arguments are optional. By default, the program loads maps/easy/01_linear_path.txt and uses window_size=3. window_size is a screen divider: 1 opens a full-screen window, 3 opens a window that is one third of your screen.

To **_clean_** the files generated by the installation :

```bash
make clean
```

To check flake8 and mypy **_norms_** :

```bash
make lint
```

To check flake8 and mypy **_norms_** with **_strict_** flags :

```bash
make lint-strict
```

To run the program with the **_python debugger_** :

```bash
make debug
```

### ALGORITHMS
 A detailed description of your algorithm choices and implementation strategy must
also be included.

### VISUALIZATION FEATURES
Documentation (?)

### RESOURCES

The links below helped me understand multi-agent algorithms and provided inspiration before I started. AI helped with debugging and was used as a reference for function prototypes and library usage in the graphics library.
